# Power_BI_London_Hotels


This project is a part of the LinkedIn Learning course "Power BI Challenges: 15 Skills-Building Analytics Exercises for Data Professionals" with instructor Emma Saunders. The course aims to enhance the proficiency of data professionals in Power BI, covering topics from creating visuals to crafting DAX expressions and utilizing the Power Query Editor through a series of challenges.

The focus of this course is on designing and generating reports in Power BI Desktop. We delve into table view, model view, and report view, as these components are essential for creating comprehensive reports. Additionally, we explore design principles and address accessibility issues.

## Overview:
Throughout the course, we will construct a report comparing the financials of two fictitious brands, H+ Sport and BinaryVille. Landon Hotel and the International Luxury Hotel Chain are contemplating portfolio diversification by acquiring one of these two companies.

### Challenge 1:
Given that Landon Hotel is considering the acquisition of H+ Sport, the management desires an overview of the business. They are particularly interested in both profit and sales, as it is possible that H-Plus sells only a limited number of highly profitable products. This presents an opportunity for Landon Hotels to enhance the business.

### Key Finding:
The government channel is generating the most profit, with a profit margin of nearly 22%.                                                                                                                   
  Although the channel partners contribute minimal dollar profit, the percentage profit is strikingly high at 73%. This information is noteworthy for consideration.

### Challenge 2:
Landon Hotel management has stipulated that any company they acquire should generate a monthly profit of $1 million.

### Key Findings:
With a target profit of $12 million, H+ has achieved a profit of $13 million in the past year.                                                                                                                    
  Examining the last 24 months reveals that H+ has been trading for about 16 months, whereas BinaryVille has been trading for the full two years.  
  Despite its shorter trading history, H+ demonstrates a more consistent level of profit, although not higher, but less volatile.

### Challenge 3:
Landon Hotels, the acquiring company, currently has sales only in North America (the US and Canada). Therefore, they are keen on understanding the geographic distribution of sales between H+ Sports and Binaryville.

### Key Findings:
H+ Sports has sales in five countries, while BinaryVille has sales in two.   
H+ records smaller values for profit and sales across multiple countries, whereas BinaryVille focuses primarily on the US and Canada, boasting significantly higher profit and sales in those regions.
